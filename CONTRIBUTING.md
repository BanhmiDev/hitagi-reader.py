Contributing to Hitagi Reader
=============================
This file contains guidelines for contributing to Hitagi Reader, as well as instructions on how to do so.

## Prerequisites
Hitagi Reader is build upon the PyQt5 library.                                     
The latest build is optimized for Python 3 and should not differ much from older Python versions.                          
Pull requests for backward-compatibility changes are always welcome.

## Localizations
A list of current available and already worked on localizations can be found [here](https://github.com/gimu/hitagi-reader/wiki/Localization).                               
Translations are done via [Qt Linguist](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/i18n.html).                                        
The translation-file will be uploaded shortly after the first release.

## Bugs & Issues
Rule of thumb: Pull requests with descriptive content.
